At this point I would like to thank everyone who supported me during this bachelor thesis. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Dr. Roland Siegwart and the \textsc{Autonomous Systems Lab} (ASL) for their continuous support of the focus project \textsc{Scubo}. Special thanks to my supervisors Dr. Gregory Hitz and Philipp Kr\"usi for guiding me successfully throughout the whole project. Last but not least, I would like to thank the whole \textsc{Scubo} team. It was an amazing roller coaster ride and I am very grateful to be a part of it since the very beginning. \\
